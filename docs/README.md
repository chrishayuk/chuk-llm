## Key Concepts

### Providers
ChukLLM supports multiple LLM providers through a unified interface. Each provider has its own client implementation that handles the specific API requirements.

### Auto-Discovery
The discovery system automatically detects available models (especially for Ollama) and generates convenience functions at runtime.

### Session Tracking
Built-in session management tracks all LLM interactions for analytics, cost monitoring, and debugging.

### Conversation Management
Stateful conversations with memory, branching, and persistence support.
