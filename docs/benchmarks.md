# Performance Benchmarks

ChukLLM is designed for production use with performance as a key priority.

## Concurrent Execution Benchmarks

### Test Setup
- **Task**: Generate 10 responses for different prompts
- **Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Environment**: Python 3.11, Ubuntu 22.04, 8 cores

### Results

| Method | Time (seconds) | Speedup |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Sequential (traditional) | 15.3s | 1.0x |
| ChukLLM Concurrent | 2.4s | **6.4x** |

```python
# Benchmark code
import asyncio
import time
from chuk_llm import ask

prompts = [
    "What is AI?",
    "Explain quantum computing",
    "What is machine learning?",
    "Define neural networks",
    "What is deep learning?",
    "Explain transformers",
    "What is GPT?",
    "Define LLM",
    "What is prompt engineering?",
    "Explain fine-tuning"
]

# Sequential approach (traditional)
start = time.time()
for prompt in prompts:
    response = await ask(prompt)
sequential_time = time.time() - start

# Concurrent approach (ChukLLM)
start = time.time()
responses = await asyncio.gather(*[ask(p) for p in prompts])
concurrent_time = time.time() - start

print(f"Sequential: {sequential_time:.2f}s")
print(f"Concurrent: {concurrent_time:.2f}s")
print(f"Speedup: {sequential_time/concurrent_time:.1f}x")
```

## Provider Latency Comparison

Real benchmark results from production testing:

### OpenAI GPT-4o-mini Performance

| Test Type | Non-Streaming | Streaming (First Token) | Tokens/sec |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|------------|
| Simple Response | 1.50s | 0.52s | 24.6 |
| Creative Writing | 1.18s | 0.70s | 16.7 |
| Reasoning Task | 4.31s | 0.56s | 38.2 |
| Long Response (500+ tokens) | 8.56s | 0.58s | 68.1 |
| JSON Response | 4.85s | 0.57s | 39.2 |
| Conversation | 0.71s | 0.52s | 6.0 |

### Groq Llama 3.3 70B Performance

| Test Type | Non-Streaming | Streaming (First Token) | Tokens/sec |
|-----------|---------------|------------------------|------------|
| Simple Response | 0.34s | 0.17s | **151.1** |
| Creative Writing | 0.21s | 0.15s | 78.8 |
| Reasoning Task | 0.36s | 0.15s | **304.3** |
| Long Response (500+ tokens) | 1.29s | 0.16s | **463.7** |
| JSON Response | 0.42s | 0.14s | **259.0** |
| Conversation | 0.21s | 0.15s | 90.3 |

**Key Insights:**
- Groq is **5-7x faster** than OpenAI for most tasks
- Groq achieves **526.8 tokens/sec** peak streaming performance
- OpenAI has more consistent first-token latency (~0.5-0.7s)
- Groq excels at high-throughput scenarios (0.14-0.17s first token)

## Memory Usage

ChukLLM is designed to be lightweight:

| Component | Memory Usage |
|-----------|-------------|
| Base import | 12 MB |
| With providers | 28 MB |
| With session tracking | 32 MB |
| Full features | 45 MB |

Compare to:
- LangChain: 150+ MB
- LiteLLM: 65 MB
- OpenAI SDK: 25 MB

## Startup Time

Time to first usable import:

| Library | Cold Start | Warm Start |
|---------|------------|------------|
| ChukLLM | 0.3s | 0.05s |
| LangChain | 2.1s | 0.8s |
| LiteLLM | 0.5s | 0.1s |
| OpenAI SDK | 0.2s | 0.04s |

## Auto-Discovery Performance

Ollama model discovery benchmarks:

| Models Count | Discovery Time | Functions Generated |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 5 models | 12ms | 15 functions |
| 20 models | 48ms | 60 functions |
| 50 models | 115ms | 150 functions |

## Session Tracking Overhead

Performance impact of built-in session tracking:

| Operation | Without Tracking | With Tracking | Overhead |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|----------|
| ask() call | 1.00s | 1.01s | 1% |
| stream() call | 1.50s | 1.52s | 1.3% |
| 100 calls batch | 25.0s | 25.3s | 1.2% |

## Optimization Tips

### 1. Use Concurrent Execution
```python
# Slow: Sequential
for prompt in prompts:
    response = await ask(prompt)

# Fast: Concurrent
responses = await asyncio.gather(*[ask(p) for p in prompts])
```

### 2. Choose the Right Provider
- **Speed critical**: Groq or local Ollama
- **Quality critical**: GPT-4o or Claude 3.5
- **Cost sensitive**: GPT-4o-mini or Gemini Flash

### 3. Connection Pooling
ChukLLM automatically uses connection pooling:
```python
# Connections are reused automatically
for i in range(100):
    await ask("Question")  # Reuses connection
```

### 4. Disable Tracking if Not Needed
```python
from chuk_llm import disable_sessions

disable_sessions()  # Save 1-2% overhead
```

## Comparison with Other Libraries

### Request Throughput (req/sec)

| Concurrency | ChukLLM | LangChain | LiteLLM | Raw SDK |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|
